	  <h1>Small Business Security Basics</h1>


<p class="timestamp">August 27, 2017</p>

<p>Cyber Security is an important subject for businesses of all sizes. Sometimes small businesses struggle with the idea of implementing a cyber security plan because of costs. If done right, these costs can be minimal and more importantly, the cost of a security breach can be avoided.</p>

<p>Here are a few tips to help your small business:</p>

<p><strong>Train your employees</strong></p>

<p>Make sure your employees understand the consequences of their behavior. Teach them to protect customer, business and private data. Make sure they know about email risks and danger.</p>

<p><strong>Update your software, PCs, servers, and devices</strong></p>

<p>Keep all your equipment up to date with the latest updates and firmware. This includes routers, switches, wireless access points, PCs, servers, tablets, phones, printers, etc.  Anything that is connected to your network should be regularly updated.</p>

<p><strong>Know your firewall</strong></p>

<p>Make sure you have a Firewall system in place, configured and functioning. I strongly advise against using only the device that your ISP (internet service provider) provides.</p>

<p><strong>Backup</strong></p>

<p>This is an often missed yet crucial part of cyber security. In addition to regulations requirements (Depends on which industry you operate) and especially in the age of ransomware, backing up your data frequently is key for your business survival. Which ever one you pick, regularly check to make sure its doing the job.</p>

<p><strong>Secure your wireless</strong></p>

<p>Make sure you wireless network is secure. You should be using WPA2-PSK at a minimum. If you haven&rsquo;t already, think about installing a Guest wireless network, separate from your business network, and providing it to your employees for their personal devices.</p>

<p><strong>Limit access</strong></p>

<p>Control physical access to computers and servers. Make sure each employee has a unique login. Make sure they only have access to the software and data that they need to do their job. Do not allow them to install software.</p>

<p><strong>Use strong passwords</strong></p>

<p>There are a number of tools available to create complex passwords, including password managers that reduce the inconvenience of managing multiple passwords. If your system allows for the use of multifactor authentication, use it!</p>

<p><strong>Make a mobile device plan</strong></p>

<p>If you allow personal and mobile devices access to your business data and email, make sure you have a plan for lost or stolen devices. All of these devices should have passwords and be encrypted. Managing your mobile devices by using Mobile Device Management (MDM) adds services like remote locate, remote lock, remote wipe and Apps management.</p>
