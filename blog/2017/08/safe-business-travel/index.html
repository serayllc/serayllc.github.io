	  <h1>Safe Business Travel</h1>


<p class="timestamp">August 27, 2017</p>

<p>Managers, owners and employees are all embracing the flexibility of working while traveling, making it the new global norm. While you are in the office, you are protected within a managed, secure network. As soon as you step away, those protections disappear, leaving your computing device and the data inside it at great risk.</p>

<p>Cyber attackers love to collect data. Almost all data can be sold, your personal details, those of your clients and suppliers, and especially your proprietary business data. These days, the information stored on your device can be worth more than the device itself.</p>

<p>Here are many ways a hacker can attack:</p>

<p><strong>Opportunity</strong> Whether your employee left their laptop at a café or a thief stole the phone from their pocket, the outcome is the same – that device is gone. Hackers will take advantage of any opportunity to gain access to a device, including asking to ‘borrow’ them for a few minutes to install spyware, before handing them back.</p>

<p><strong>Spoofing</strong> We’ve all come to expect free Wi-Fi networks wherever we go. Hackers will take advantage of this trust to create their own free, unsecure network, just waiting for a naive traveler.</p>

<p><strong>Sniffing</strong> Hackers don’t need to own the Wi-Fi network to steal content from it. Data traveling across an unsecure network is visible and available to anyone with the right software.</p>

<p>Taking precautions can help protect your business data:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make a backup before you travel.</p></li>

<li><p>Don’t use public Wi-Fi: Wait until you have access to a secure network before going online – even just to check email.</p></li>

<li><p>Use passwords and full drive encryption.</p></li>

<li><p>Have a mobile device plan. If your device is lost or stolen, immediately notify the appropriate people. This might include your bank so they can lock down accounts and any staff who might be tricked into allowing further data loss.</p></li>
</ul>
