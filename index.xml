      <description>Managers, owners and employees are all embracing the flexibility of working while traveling, making it the new global norm. While you are in the office, you are protected within a managed, secure network. As soon as you step away, those protections disappear, leaving your computing device and the data inside it at great risk.
Cyber attackers love to collect data. Almost all data can be sold, your personal details, those of your clients and suppliers, and especially your proprietary business data.</description>
