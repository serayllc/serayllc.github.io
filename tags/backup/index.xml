      <description>The Smart and Easy Way to Protect Your Data
You can either tear out your hair when disaster strikes, or you can prepare ahead of time. Online backup services are one of the best ways to protect yourself against loss of computer data, whether it&amp;rsquo;s caused by a crashed hard drive, unintentional deletion, natural disaster, or ransomware attack.
Our service technicians can install an online backup service on you PC that scans your drive for files which have changed since your last backup, encrypts them for security, and sends them up to high-storage-capacity servers attached to the internet.</description>
